This folder contains deprecated documentation kept for reference.

**MotherDuck docs:** The stack now uses Lambda + S3 for provisioning (polygon → Supabase → Tile Lambda → S3 snapshots → addresses and snapshot metadata in Supabase). MotherDuck is no longer used. See [ARCHITECTURE_PROVISION.md](../ARCHITECTURE_PROVISION.md) and [BACKEND_API_CONTRACT.md](../BACKEND_API_CONTRACT.md).
